# Production Environment Configuration for Sentinel OS Frontend

# Backend URL - Your actual Render backend URL
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://sentinel-os.onrender.com

# This file serves as documentation of the correct backend URL to use
# If you need to deploy the frontend to another platform or environment,
# make sure to set VITE_BACKEND_URL to this value in your environment variables.

# For Vercel deployment:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project settings
# 2. Navigate to Environment Variables
# 3. Add VITE_BACKEND_URL with the value above
# 4. Redeploy your application

# Note: For local development, you can create a .env.local file with:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 (if running backend locally)
# or VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://sentinel-os.onrender.com (to use production backend)
